    "Dataset Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, I provided several interesting datasets, including the New York City Squirrel Census. However, the user preferred the Titanic passenger survival dataset from the link provided on the Tablab website.\n",
    "Counting Missing Values:\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was uploaded and missing values were analyzed. We found missing values in the following fields:\n",
    "Age: 177 missing values\n",
    "Cabin: 687 missing values\n",
    "Embarked: 2 missing values\n",
    "Loading Data into a Notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python script was created to load the dataset into a notebook using pandas. The initial version was intended for a locally stored file. The final version adapted to use the Titanic dataset hosted online at the URL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv.\n",
