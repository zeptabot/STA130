    "**Variables:**`LONELY_dejong_emotional_loneliness_sub_scale_score` from both the 2021 cross-sectional survey and the 2022 cohort survey, reported by the same individuals (same ID across two surveys). This numerical score assesses the level of emotional loneliness experienced by individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Relevance*: Emotional loneliness is a critical indicator of social connections.\n",
    "\n",

Due to the computational intensity of calculating each possible combination, we will utilize a **Monte Carlo simulation** to estimate the p-value accurately.
